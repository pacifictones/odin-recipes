    <h2>Time to Jazz Up that Instant Ramen</h2>
    <p>
        Instant Ramen isn't just for poor college kids anymore! He is a way to 
        really up your ramen game, and it all stuff you probably have in your 
        kitchen already. If you don't then you need ot seriously invest some Time
        in the kitchen basics.

        First, we prep everything. Get a few vegetables to chuck in. I like carrots
        and potatoes. Cut them up into small pieces, whatever shape you prefer. 
        Next we need some seasoning. I use the season packet included but I mix 
        in some chicken stock and yes, cubes work too. Then I throw in some garlic
        and ginger. Dump a bit of soy in, dark or light. Taste it!
        Boil all this together. when the vegetables are done, chuck in the noodles. 
        When those are done, dump it into a bowl. Dress with spring onions and a soft-
        boiled egg -- or whatever you like, really.
