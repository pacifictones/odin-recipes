         <h2>Easy and Authentic Italian Creamy Pasta with Bacon</h2>
         <p>
             This is a very easy recipe and way better than anything 
             you'll get from a jar. The first step is measuring out the ingredients.
             Once you have the right about of pasta, an egg prepped your bacon, pepper
             and cheese, you'll be good to go!
         </p>
         <p>
             That's right, you can pretty much count all your ingredients on one hand. 
             You'l fry up the bacon whilst boiling the pasta. In a bowl, mix the other 
             ingredients together. When the pasta is al dente, pull it out with tongs (Don't
             drain the water) and put it in the pan. Don't forget to take the pan from the hot flame. 
             stir and add pasta water until it no longer sizzles in the pan. This means the pan
             is just hot enough and you can now add the egg sauce you've mixed up already. 
             add it in a bit at a time and don't be afraid to add a bit more water. Stir until 
             creamy then enjoy!
